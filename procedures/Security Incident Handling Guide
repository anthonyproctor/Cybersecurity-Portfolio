# Data Classification Policy

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish a standardized approach for classifying and handling data based on its sensitivity, ensuring compliance with security regulations such as ISO 27001 and NIST 800-53.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party service providers who access, process, store, or transmit organizational data.

## 3. Data Classification Levels
Data shall be classified into four categories based on its confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements:

### **3.1 Public Data**
- Definition: Information that is approved for public release and poses no risk if disclosed.
- Examples: Marketing materials, website content, press releases.
- Handling: No restrictions on storage, transmission, or access.

### **3.2 Internal Use Only**
- Definition: Non-public information intended for internal business operations.
- Examples: Organizational policies, internal communications, non-sensitive reports.
- Handling: Accessible only to employees and authorized personnel.

### **3.3 Confidential Data**
- Definition: Sensitive information that requires protection due to legal, regulatory, or business requirements.
- Examples: Employee records, client information, intellectual property.
- Handling:
  - Encryption must be applied during storage and transmission.
  - Access must be restricted to authorized personnel.
  - Must not be shared externally without proper authorization.

### **3.4 Restricted Data**
- Definition: Highly sensitive data that, if disclosed, could cause severe financial, legal, or reputational damage.
- Examples: Payment card data, health records, trade secrets.
- Handling:
  - Encryption is mandatory for storage and transmission.
  - Access is limited to a need-to-know basis with multi-factor authentication (MFA).
  - Data should not be stored on personal devices.

## 4. Data Handling Requirements
- **Storage:** Confidential and Restricted data must be stored in secured, access-controlled environments.
- **Transmission:** Encryption is required for transmitting Confidential and Restricted data over public or untrusted networks.
- **Disposal:** Confidential and Restricted data must be securely deleted or shredded when no longer needed.
- **Access Control:** Role-based access control (RBAC) must be enforced to prevent unauthorized data access.

## 5. Compliance & Monitoring
- Regular audits shall be conducted to ensure compliance with classification policies.
- Non-compliance incidents must be reported and addressed promptly.
- Employees must receive training on data classification procedures annually.

## 6. Roles & Responsibilities
- **Data Owners:** Responsible for classifying and managing access to their respective data assets.
- **IT Security Team:** Implements and enforces security controls for classified data.
- **Employees:** Follow classification and handling guidelines for all organizational data.
