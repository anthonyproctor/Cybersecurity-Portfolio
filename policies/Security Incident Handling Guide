Security Incident Handling Guide

1. Purpose

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for detecting, responding to, and mitigating security incidents to minimize organizational risk and disruption.

2. Scope

Applies to all employees, IT staff, and third-party service providers involved in monitoring, detecting, or responding to security incidents.

3. Incident Handling Process

Step 1: Identification

Detect suspicious activities through system logs, IDS/IPS alerts, and user reports.

Verify if the activity qualifies as a security incident.

Categorize incidents (e.g., malware infection, unauthorized access, phishing attack, data breach).

Step 2: Containment

Short-term containment: Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage.

Long-term containment: Apply patches, disable compromised accounts, or change credentials.

Document containment actions taken.

Step 3: Eradication

Identify and remove malicious elements (e.g., malware, rogue processes, compromised credentials).

Conduct forensic analysis to determine the root cause.

Strengthen security controls to prevent recurrence.

Step 4: Recovery

Restore affected systems from clean backups.

Test and verify system integrity before resuming operations.

Monitor for any signs of recurring threats.

Step 5: Post-Incident Review

Document the incident, response actions, and lessons learned.

Update security policies and procedures as needed.

Conduct awareness training if human error contributed to the incident.

4. Roles & Responsibilities

Incident Response Team (IRT): Leads incident handling efforts and coordinates response.

IT Security Team: Analyzes and mitigates technical aspects of the incident.

Management: Makes high-level decisions on remediation and communication.

Employees: Report incidents and follow security protocols.

5. Compliance & Reporting

All incidents must be logged and reviewed for compliance with ISO 27001, NIST, and relevant regulations.

Reports of major incidents must be shared with stakeholders as per organizational policy.
