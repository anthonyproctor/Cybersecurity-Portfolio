Compliance Mapping: NIST 800-53 to HIPAA Security Rule
1. Purpose
This document outlines the mapping of controls from the NIST 800-53 framework to the HIPAA Security Rule. The goal is to provide a cross-reference of security requirements to assist organizations in meeting HIPAA compliance while adhering to best practices set forth by NIST.

2. Scope
This mapping applies to healthcare organizations that need to comply with both NIST 800-53 and HIPAA Security Rule, specifically regarding the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). This mapping serves as a guide to align security controls across these frameworks.

3. Mapping of NIST 800-53 to HIPAA Security Rule
NIST 800-53 Control	HIPAA Security Rule Requirement	Description/Mapping
AC-2: Account Management	164.308(a)(3)(i) – Access Control	Requires that organizations control access to ePHI, ensuring proper account management practices (e.g., user authentication, termination, and role-based access).
AC-6: Least Privilege	164.308(a)(4) – Information Access Management	Ensures that access to ePHI is based on the minimum necessary standard, restricting access to only those with a valid need to know.
AU-2: Audit Events	164.312(b) – Audit Controls	Requires organizations to implement audit controls to log and monitor access to ePHI, maintaining logs of activities that could be used to detect security incidents.
IA-2: Identification and Authentication	164.312(d) – Person or Entity Authentication	NIST’s requirement to ensure accurate identification and authentication aligns with HIPAA's need for verifying the identity of users who access ePHI.
IR-4: Incident Handling	164.308(a)(6)(i) – Security Incident Procedures	NIST's incident handling process maps to HIPAA’s requirement to establish procedures for responding to and reporting security incidents involving ePHI.
MP-5: Media Transport Protection	164.310(d)(1) – Movement of Electronic Protected Health Information	Ensures that ePHI is protected during transmission across networks, preventing unauthorized access or exposure of ePHI in transit.
PE-3: Physical Access Control	164.310(a)(1) – Facility Access Controls	Protects the physical access to systems storing ePHI, requiring organizations to implement safeguards such as locking server rooms and controlling access to facilities.
SA-4: Security Engineering	164.306(a)(1) – Security Standards	Ensures that system security is engineered into information systems handling ePHI, applying both administrative and technical safeguards to protect data integrity and confidentiality.
SC-12: Cryptographic Key Establishment and Management	164.312(a)(2)(iv) – Transmission Security	Focuses on cryptographic protections, ensuring that ePHI is protected during transmission across open networks via encryption and other technical controls.
SI-2: Flaw Remediation	164.308(a)(8) – Evaluation and Risk Analysis	Requires that organizations regularly assess their security environment and remediate any identified security vulnerabilities that could impact the confidentiality and integrity of ePHI.
4. Key Considerations
Access Control: Both frameworks emphasize controlling and managing access to ePHI. This includes ensuring user authentication, authorization, and role-based access.
Audit and Monitoring: Both NIST and HIPAA require mechanisms to track access and modification of ePHI to support incident detection and response.
Data Integrity: Protecting the integrity and confidentiality of ePHI is central to both sets of controls. NIST's emphasis on cryptographic protections (SC-12) directly supports HIPAA's transmission security requirements (164.312(a)(2)(iv)).
Incident Response: Both NIST and HIPAA require organizations to have policies in place for handling security incidents, including reporting and responding promptly to protect ePHI.
Risk Analysis: Regular risk assessments are critical in both frameworks to ensure potential threats and vulnerabilities to ePHI are identified and mitigated.
5. Conclusion
This mapping helps align the NIST 800-53 security controls with the HIPAA Security Rule requirements, providing a structured approach for healthcare organizations to meet security and compliance objectives. By implementing the relevant controls, organizations can ensure they protect ePHI while adhering to industry standards and regulatory requirements.
