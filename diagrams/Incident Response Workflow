# Incident Response Workflow (Process Flow Diagram)

## 1. Purpose
This document outlines the key steps involved in responding to security incidents using a structured workflow. The diagram provides a visual representation of the process to aid in quick decision-making.

## 2. Workflow Steps
### **1. Detection & Identification**
- Monitor security logs, IDS/IPS alerts, and user reports.
- Verify if the activity qualifies as a security incident.
- Categorize the incident (e.g., malware, unauthorized access, data breach).

### **2. Containment**
- Implement immediate containment measures (e.g., isolate affected systems, revoke credentials).
- Determine if short-term or long-term containment is required.

### **3. Eradication**
- Identify and remove the root cause (e.g., malware removal, vulnerability patching).
- Conduct forensic analysis if necessary.

### **4. Recovery**
- Restore affected systems from backups.
- Verify system integrity before resuming operations.
- Monitor for any recurrence of threats.

### **5. Post-Incident Review**
- Document incident details, response effectiveness, and lessons learned.
- Update security policies and procedures based on findings.

## 3. Diagram
A process flow diagram should be created using tools like Visio, Lucidchart, or Draw.io to represent the above steps visually. The diagram should illustrate:
1. **Incident Detection Sources** (e.g., security logs, SOC monitoring, employee reports)
2. **Decision Points** (e.g., Is this a true incident? Does it require containment?)
3. **Action Steps** (e.g., containment, eradication, system recovery)
4. **Post-Incident Activities** (e.g., lessons learned, documentation, security updates)

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities
- **Security Analysts:** Identify and categorize incidents.
- **Incident Response Team (IRT):** Leads containment and eradication efforts.
- **IT Operations:** Assists in recovery and system restoration.
- **Management:** Approves major response actions and reviews post-incident reports.

## 5. Compliance & Best Practices
- Ensure alignment with **NIST 800-61** (Incident Response Guide) and **ISO 27035**.
- Maintain logs and audit trails for compliance reporting.
- Regularly update and test the workflow to improve response efficiency.
