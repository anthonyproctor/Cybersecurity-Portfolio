3. Risk Register Breakdown
Risk ID: A unique identifier for the risk.
Risk Description: A clear description of the risk, highlighting the potential threat or vulnerability.
Risk Category: The general category to which the risk belongs (e.g., Security, Cybersecurity, Operational, Compliance, etc.).
Likelihood (1-5): The likelihood or probability of the risk occurring, rated on a scale from 1 (Low) to 5 (High).
Impact (1-5): The potential impact of the risk on the organization, rated on a scale from 1 (Low) to 5 (High).
Risk Rating (Likelihood x Impact): The overall severity of the risk, calculated by multiplying the likelihood and impact ratings. A higher score indicates a higher priority for mitigation.
Mitigation Strategy: Specific actions and strategies in place or planned to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk.
Responsible Party: The team or individual responsible for managing or mitigating the risk.
Status: The current status of the risk (e.g., Open, In Progress, Closed).
Review Date: The date when the risk will be reviewed to evaluate whether the mitigation strategy is effective or if additional actions are required.
4. Key Takeaways
Prioritization: Risks with higher likelihood and impact ratings are prioritized for immediate action. For example, R001 (Data Breach due to Unauthorized Access) has the highest risk rating and is being actively mitigated by the IT Security Team.
Mitigation Actions: Each risk has a defined mitigation strategy to reduce its likelihood or impact, with responsible parties assigned to ensure implementation.
Regular Reviews: Risks should be reviewed periodically, with changes in status updated regularly to reflect progress and any shifts in the organization's risk environment.
